# Building_and-Training_Model_through_CNN_on_MNIST_Dataset
This project focuses on building and training a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for image classification on the MNIST dataset. The model is designed to recognize handwritten digits (0-9) and achieves a test accuracy of 98%.

Key Features:
Model Architecture: Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
Dataset: MNIST, a large database of handwritten digits
Test Accuracy: 98%
How the Model Works:
The model utilizes multiple convolutional layers to extract features from the input images, followed by dense layers for classification. The MNIST dataset is loaded directly within the code using mnist.load_data().

Feel free to explore the code and experiment with different configurations!
